<div id="goodbye">
	<p> Saying good bye not that hard after all
Am so sick of the doubt you bring 
You used to be in Control
You were the puppet master
I was dangling on for dear life

Let me be honest
I was alive but I never lived when you were in Control
I’m opening the cell you kept me in 

I thought you kept me safe 

But you bamboozle swindle me in to thinking I was a damsel in distress

But I could never play that role quite right 

So I am saying goodbye to you 
Have a nice day 

I refuse to be the prey
Wait to be devoured by the unknown

So farewell fear 
I don’t mean to be Blunt but 

But get out 
You’re irrelevant in my plan
Matter-of-fact nonexistent
 
Take your friends with too 
You know doubt, self-pity, and my least favorite insecurity 

One last thing Fear
Before I let you go forever I want you to know you were nothing with me 

I created you
Gave you the power over me 

Now looking back I feel so stupid
How could I be so foolish

But it’s all over now 

I’m cutting the mental cord that had me attaches me to you 

Have a nice day torturing someone else
Let me be clear that person wont be me Nor will it ever be!!
